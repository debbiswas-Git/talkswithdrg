# Scott Kuntzelman
I've been a computer professional for ~35 years, 27 with my current company.

I have a MSCS and a BSCS (*Summa Cum Laude*) from [University of Illinois - Springfield](https://csc.uis.edu/)

I currently spend much of my time in the command line with PowerShell (I'm responsible for all of the Wintel Servers in the region) and I'm trying to start learning more of the tools so that I can participate in the community as more than just a consumer.

And I really think that Dr. G is **one of the best presenters** at this year's Ignite!
