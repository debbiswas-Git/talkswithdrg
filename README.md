# Talks with Dr. G

Want to find one of my upcoming talks? Or have you attended one recently (thanks for coming!! :) ) 

Here you will find links and information for upcoming talks and resources for talks that I have already given. 

For talks that introduce GitHub, I usually have a way for you to add your name to show you attended (and so that you can try out your first PR (pull request) in a safe place :) )

Generally, the best place to find my content is on YouTube:
- [Dr Guthals](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgvODZ135iGUbhqE9bSjVSg) - Focused on the adult developer, here you can find tech talks, panels/interviews, live streams, and more!
- [We Can with Dr G](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-iq8A4aamvIWVf038rWcyw) - Focused on the younger developer, here you can find a lot of Minecraft, block-based coding, and intro level fun!

I also am doing a lot more streaming these days! Join me and my friends as we build, break, and play at [twitch.tv/drguthals](https://www.twitch.tv/drguthals). 

For my day job, I do a weekly pre-recorded show on [Microsoft's Channel 9 (C9)](https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/Learn-with-Dr-G) and weekly Live Streams, which you can catch every Tuesday from 3-3:55pm PT on:
- [Learn TV](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/tv)
- [Microsoft Developer Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/microsoftdeveloper)
- [Microsoft Developer YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/microsoftdeveloper)
