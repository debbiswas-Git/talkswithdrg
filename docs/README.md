# Talks with Dr. G

Want to find one of my upcoming talks? Streams? Or have you attended one recently?

Here you will find links and information for upcoming talks and resources for talks that I have already given. Check out my [upcoming talks](#2021-talks) below.

For talks that introduce GitHub, I usually have a way for you to add your name to show you attended (and so that you can try out your first PR (pull request)!)

## Where to Find Me and My Content

For any live streaming, you can checkout my [upcoming streams here](#streaming-schedule).

The best place to find my content is on YouTube:
- [Dr Guthals](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgvODZ135iGUbhqE9bSjVSg) - Focused on the adult developer, here you can find tech talks, panels/interviews, live streams, and more!
- [We Can with Dr G](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-iq8A4aamvIWVf038rWcyw) - Focused on the younger developer, here you can find a lot of Minecraft, block-based coding, and intro level fun!

For my day job, I do a weekly pre-recorded show on [Microsoft's Channel 9 (C9)](https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/Learn-with-Dr-G)

## Bio and Headshots

Keeping track of bios and headshots is hard...so I am storing them all here!

You can find [bios on this page](bios.md) and [headshots in this folder](https://github.com/sguthals/talkswithdrg/tree/main/docs/media).
