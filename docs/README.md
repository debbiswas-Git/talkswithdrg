# Talks with Dr. G

Want to find one of my upcoming talks? Or have you attended one recently?

Here you will find links and information for upcoming talks and resources for talks that I have already given. 

For talks that introduce GitHub, I usually have a way for you to add your name to show you attended (and so that you can try out your first PR (pull request)!)

Generally, the best place to find my content is on YouTube:
- [Dr Guthals](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgvODZ135iGUbhqE9bSjVSg) - Focused on the adult developer, here you can find tech talks, panels/interviews, live streams, and more!
- [We Can with Dr G](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-iq8A4aamvIWVf038rWcyw) - Focused on the younger developer, here you can find a lot of Minecraft, block-based coding, and intro level fun!

I also am doing a lot more streaming these days! Join me and my friends as we build, break, and play at [twitch.tv/drguthals](https://www.twitch.tv/drguthals). 

For my day job, I do a weekly pre-recorded show on [Microsoft's Channel 9 (C9)](https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/Learn-with-Dr-G) and weekly Live Streams, which you can catch every Tuesday from 3-3:55pm PT on:
- [Learn TV](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/tv)
- [Microsoft Developer Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/microsoftdeveloper)
- [Microsoft Developer YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/microsoftdeveloper)

Checkout my [upcoming streams here](streaming.md).

### Bio and Headshots

Keeping track of bios and headshots is hard...so I am storing them all here!

You can find [bios on this page](bios.md) and [headshots in this folder](https://github.com/sguthals/talkswithdrg/tree/main/docs/media).
