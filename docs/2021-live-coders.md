| It Wasn't Just Luck | As the daughter of a single, immigrant, mother, Sarah knew one thing since she was a child: She loved teaching and learning, she never wanted to sleep in a car again. Now with her PhD in computer science and a principal program manager at Microsoft, she is dedicating her career to encouraging and teaching others to discover their own passions and paths through life. But with a daughter of her own now, the "path" isn't so much a path anymore, but a never-ending set of decisions, defenses, and challenges to overcome. In this session, "Dr G" will describe the challenges of focusing on education in tech, starting a company, and being a mom. | Monday, March 8, 2021 | 9:15 - 10:00am PDT | [wasnt-just-luck/](2021-live-coders-luck.md) | [Watch Here!](https://livecoders.dev/conference/) |
