| The Data Behind Space Exploration with NASA | Data science is a field that influences all aspects of our scientific community, including space exploration. Inspired by NASA, weâ€™ve developed new content for analyzing space rocks and determining the likelihood of a successful rocket launch into space. Join this session to explore this data and to perhaps develop your own space exploration study using Visual Studio Code and a bit of Python. This session recommends a basic understanding of Visual Studio Code and Python programming. | Wednesday, September 23, 2020 | 3:15 - 3:45pm PDT | [data-in-space/](2020-ignite-data.md) | [Watch the Recording](https://youtu.be/OQrt766zTVw) |
