# Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador Events

[The Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador](https://studentambassadors.microsoft.com/) is for current college/university students. The program helps you find your 
community, which is more important than ever as classes and social activities take place virtually, and amplify your impact and bring together your peers to learn 
new skills, solve real-world problems, and build communities across the globe.

| Intro to AI with Netflix's Over the Moon | The Lunar rover has been instrumental in helping us advance our understanding of the Moon and our Universe, and in the new [Netflix Original, Over the Moon](https://www.netflix.com/title/80214236), it makes an appearance when Fei Fei lands on the moon with her buddy Bungee and brother Chin. In this workshop we will build an image classifier using Azure Custom Vision to identify Bungee so that the Lunar Rover can capture in-the-moment pictures of her instead of Moon rocks!
