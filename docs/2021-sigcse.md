| Ushering in a New and Diverse Workforce | We expect to see 150 million tech or tech-adjacent jobs over the next five years. Those who create with technology will shape our future, and there shouldnâ€™t be barriers to learning the skills required to do so. To help meet this demand, we must make technical and non-technical learning more accessible to anyone who wants to learn. We must evolve industry and academic partnerships. We must address gaps in digital platforms to facilitate seamless and collaborative learning. We must help build a more inclusive future by fostering culture change, increasing diversity, and enabling a sense of belonging. | Monday, March 15, 2021 | 3:45 - 5pm PDT | [new-diverse](2021-sigcse-diverse.md) | [Register Here](http://sigcse2021.sigcse.org/schedule/supportersessions/) |
